### Previews

### Focus Areas: 
One of my priorities was to implement a robust **MVVM** architecture for several reasons:

- To make sure the app is clean and scalable
- Keep UI, business logic, and data models separated to mitigate complexity
- Make the codebase more testable since ViewModels can be unit tested independently
- Maintainable in case of need for expansion of features
- Cleaner SwiftUI Views that were focused mainly on presentation and interaction without business-logic seeping into it
- Reusability of code
- MVVM promotes consistent codebase structures
- Easier state management
- Keeps asyncronous code out of Views

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

In total, I had spent around 3 hours of actual coding time. Here is a breakdown of my time allocation using percentages:

- Planning and Setup: ~11% of total
- Core functions: ~42%
- UI: ~17%
- Error handling: ~11%
- Testing: ~11%
- Submission and README: ~8%

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I gave myself a 4-hour time window to simulate the need for making a quick delivery. I focused on building fewer features with better code quality, rather than trying to implement every possible screen or edge case.
I aimed to deliver a clean, stable, and well-structured codebase within a limited timeframe while still leaving room for future feature stories. 
The goal was to create a working and maintainable workflow rather than implement a bunch of half-done features.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Due to my goal for this project, which was to deliver workable and maintainable code quickly, I placed less priority on polishing the UI and design. I put more focus on the business logic, architecture, and data flow.
Future iterations of UI improvements and additions would be easier with a clean structure to build upon.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

My approach to this project was to simulate delivering a production-ready foundation within a limited timeframe. I focused on modularity, clean code, and workability, knowing that a well-structured codebase is easier to scale or hand off to another team if needed.
